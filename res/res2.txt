These ain't no Guess jeans
I dropped out of school, I'm still good at math but nigga don't test me
I played to the left, they went to the right, they tried to finesse me
Still riding around with that blicky out, I hope they don't catch me
Police had raided our spot so we went to the next street
Play like I'm dumb, as soon as he pop, I'm going retarded
